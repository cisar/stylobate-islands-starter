# An example and a template for using Islands Stylobate skin

Just clone it somewhere recursively:

``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yandex-ui/stylobate-islands-starter
```

And you're ready to go! You'll have `style.styl` with everything set up, so you can begin to write your code using Stylobate and its Islands skin.
